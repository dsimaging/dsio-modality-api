      summary: Create Acquisition Session
      description: >
        Creates an acquisition session using the supplied device. 
        
          To acquire images from a device, you must first create an `AcquisitionSession`. When a session is created for a device, that device is marked as in use (Device Status changes to `InUse`). The session and the images associated with it persists until the session is deleted. The basic steps needed to acquire an image are:
          - Create a new session with an `Available` device
            - Subscribe to `AcquisitionStatus` Event in order react to exposure readiness
            - Send `AcquisitionInfo` with `enable` set to true
            - Wait for `AcquisitionStatus` to report `ready` as true
            - Inform user that they may initiate x-ray exposure
            - Wait for `AcquisitionStatus` to report `NewImage` or a new `lastImageId` is provided 
            - Retrieve `ImageInfo` for the newly acquired image and download the image using the `imageUrl` property
          - Delete the acquisition session

Once the client has supplied AcquisitionInfo with `enable` set to true and the sensor is ready to acquire, the state will transition to `Ready`. When the user exposes the sensor, the state will automatically transition to `Reading`, followed by `Processing`, `Storing`, `NewImage` and finally return to `NoAcquisitionInfo` as it prepares for the next exposure. 
            
              The state property will contain one of the following values:
              * `Error` - An error has occurred and acquisition is unavailable.
              * `LowBattery` - A warning that the device does not have enough power to continue. The device must be recharged.

    LutInfo:
        description: |
          Describes the lookup table (LUT) mapping applied to an image. Images acquired by this service may be mapped using a non-linear LUT in order to provide an image suitable for presentation (see the `applyLut` property of `AcquisitionInfo`). The LUT is created according to the following equation:

            Y = m(x&prime;<sup>&gamma;</sup>) + b
            
            where
            * m is the slope
            * b is the offset
            * &gamma; is the gamma value
            * x&prime; is a normalized pixel scaled to the range [0,1]
            
          If desired, the original pixel data (X) can be recovered from the mapped pixel (Y) using the LutInfo:
            
            X = (X<sub>max</sub> - X<sub>min</sub>) * [(Y - b) / m]<sup>1/&gamma;</sup> + X<sub>min</sub>
            
            where
            * m is the slope
            * b is the offset
            * &gamma; is the gamma value
            * X<sub>min</sub> is the minimum gray value
